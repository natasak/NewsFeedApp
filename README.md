# NewsFeedApp
News Feed App for Udacity's networking course in "Android Basics" series.

An app gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet, using Guardian API (http://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/). Added Settings Screen, which allows users to narrow down the articles displayed in from the feed. The available preference options presented to the user are order-by (newest, relevance) and section (travel, sport, business).
